[mailbox]
# folders specifies the name of the IMAP folders where messages are read
# from. Only "old" mail will be processed. "old" is currently hardcoded to mean
# all mail except mail which is younger than 30 days or is still unread or
# flagged ("starred").
# This is a table ("dictionary") that maps source folders to target folders.
# An empty target folder may be given to signify that mails should be written
# back to the source folder.
# In the following example, mail from the Inbox will be encrypted and written back
# to the Inbox, mail from "SomeDir" will be encrypted and archived to "CryptedSomeDir".
